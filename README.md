# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
To use Excel to analyze ER data and create dashboards that help understand patient trends, wait times, and hospital performance.

## Data set used
- <a href ="https://github.com/Pushkar2520/Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis/blob/main/Hospital%20Emergency%20Room%20Data.csv"> HE Room Data<a/>
- <a href="https://github.com/Pushkar2520/Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis/blob/main/Hospital%20Emergency%20Room%20Analysis.xlsx">Analysed Dataset<a/>

## Question (KPIs)
- How many patients visited the ER in April?
- what was the average patient wait time?
- What was the average patient satisfaction score?
- What percentage of patients arrived on time vs. delayed?
- What is the gender distribution among ER patients?
- What percentage of patients were admitted vs. not admitted?
- Which age groups had the highest number of ER visits?
- Which departments referred the most patients to the ER?
- How many patients arrived without any referral?

## Process
- Imported raw ER data into Excel
- Cleaned data: removed duplicates, fixed formats, handled missing values
- Standardized data types and ensured consistency
- Created pivot tables to answer key questions (e.g., wait time, referrals)
- Built charts and KPIs from pivot tables
- Designed an interactive dashboard using slicers and visuals

## Project Insights
- Majority of patients (263) visited the ER without any referral.
- Average wait time was 34.90 minutes, indicating potential delays in service.
- Only 56.9% of patients arrived on time, suggesting a need for better appointment or triage management.
- Gender distribution was nearly equal: 51% female, 49% male.
- Highest number of visits came from age groups 60–69, 0–9, and 10–19, indicating demand from both elderly and children.
- Most referrals came from General Practice and Orthopedics.
- Admission rate was 49.48%, showing half the cases required further hospital care. 

## Final Conclusion
The dashboard highlights critical areas like high self-referral rates, delayed arrivals, and long wait times. These insights can help hospital management improve scheduling, staffing, and patient flow in the emergency room for better operational efficiency and patient satisfaction.
